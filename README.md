# Secret_Santa_App
A small console/terminal application for creating a secret Santa group 

Add the following to a local app.config file with the login and password of the desired sending account.
For security it probably shouldn't be an important work/personal account.

<appSettings> 
  <add key="sendingemailaddress" value="email" /> 
  <add key="sendingemailpassword" value="password" /> 
</appSettings>
